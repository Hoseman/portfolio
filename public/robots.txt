Dear Sir/Madam

I am an experienced Front End Developer, with good core skills in Wordpress and with a passion for Wordpress theme development.

I am currently seeking alternative employment and I am looking for a suitable role where I can harness my core skills and talents.

I wish to apply for the role of Wordpress Developer, currently being advertised. Please find enclosed my CV for your consideration. 

As you can see from my attached CV, I have around 10 years agency experience as a Wordpress Developer, and I believe the knowledge and skills built up during this time make me the right candidate for the role.

I have good skills in Wordpress Theme Development, WooCommerce, Javascript, HTML, CSS, PHP, jQuery and SQL, and I am very experienced at building Wordpress themes from scratch.

Below are some examples of recent work:

Yours faithfully
